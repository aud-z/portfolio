# Introduction

I’ve been making an effort to limit the amount of food I waste. Especially after moving to an apartment that does not offer composting, I’ve realized the importance of actually planning out my meals so that I can consume everything I buy before they spoil. With so much emphasis on environmental issues and sustainability in recent political dialogue, it can feel overwhelming and difficult to understand how each of us can take action that actually makes a positive environmental impact. I believe that eliminating food waste is something we can all do that would make a considerable impact towards a more sustainable future, and I’d like to use this project to create awareness around this issue. 

# Outline
## Let’s talk about food waste… 

What do we think of when we think of food? Nourishing. Fulfillment. An experience shared with friends and family. But what often goes unnoticed is the amount of food gone to waste, ending up in landfills around the globe. In this section, I plan on providing a brief introduction to food waste using various statistics to drive home the immense quantity of food we throw away each year. 

Food loss and waste refers to the decrease in mass or nutritional value of food throughout the supply chain that was intended for human consumption.  In the United States, food takes up more space in landfills than anything else: 
-	22% of municipal solid waste is food waste
-	Est. 30-40% of the entire U.S. food supply is wasted each year, equivalent to an annual waste of 66.5 million tons

In 2010, the US wasted enough food to fill the empire state building 91 times. This is in stark contrast to the fact that around 11% of all US households experience food insecurity, highlighting the glaring inequities in food access and financial resources. 

## Environmental impact

If food waste could be represented as its own country, it would be the third largest greenhouse gas emitter, behind China and US.  In this section, I plan to highlight the environmental impact of so much food waste.

In the US, only 5% of food is composted. The rest ends up in landfills. Food waste that ends up in landfills produces a large amount of methane and CO<sub>2</sub> (3.3 billion tons of CO<sub>2</sub>). It also represents a great waste of freshwater and ground water resources used to produce the food. By throwing out 1 kg of beef, 50,000 litres of water are wasted. A glass of milk down the drain is equivalent to 1,000 litres of water wasted. Millions of gallons of oil are also wasted every year to produce food that is not eaten.  Food waste is responsible for more than 25% of all the freshwater consumption in the US each year, and is among the leading causes of fresh water pollution. 

## How much food is wasted at home? 

Food waste is generated at all stages of the food pipeline, from the agricultural industry to the end-point consumers. However, unlike other key drivers of of emissions/global warming, the consumer impact *isn't* significantly outweighed by companies and manufacturers. 43% of all food waste occurs at the consumer level, in our homes and everyday lives. In comparison, 40% comes from restaurants, grocery stores, and food service companies, 16% from farms, and 2% from manufacturers. This represents a huge opportunity for us to create an impact through consciously reducing food waste. 

## Why do we waste so much food? 

In the US, more than 80% of Americans discard food because they misunderstand expiration labels.  That’s an easy problem to fix with just a little more public education! This section aims to explore the main reasons we, the consumers, waste food, and what we can do about it. 

## Waste not, want not

we all have a big responsibility in helping to reduce food waste. The good news is that several states are taking action across the country to curb food waste. Companies are also innovating new ways to use food waste as ingredients for other products. But that’s not enough.

As every day citizens, we can all take action to be more responsible consumers of food and reduce food waste. This section will include the final call-to-action with a few recommended resources for learning, food planning, and activism.  

# Sketches

Below are some initial sketches of the data I plan to visualize as part of this project.

The first visualization will be a Sankey graph showing the flow of food waste from each source to each sink (processing plant). The key idea is to highlight how much of the waste is flowing from households/consumers to landfills.

I will also include a graph visualizing the percentage of households living with food insecurity, and the percentage of households with children living in food insecurity, over time.

I also thought it would be interesting to see the proportion of food waste coming from diffent sources (consumers, retailers, etc) by country. The following stacked bar graph hops to capture that.

Additional ideas include:
- using a map to visualize the amount of food waste per capita, using gradients to indicate countries with higher vs. lower waste amounts
- using a tree map to segregate the amount of food wasted by category (grains, produce, eggs, etc) by consumer versus retail sources 

# Data

Much of the problem surrounding food waste is the lack of a consistent reporting system. A significant portion of statistics for this assignment will be compiled from news releases and websites relevant to the topic. Several datasets will supplement the analysis: 

-	[Food Waste Index Report](https://www.unep.org/resources/report/unep-food-waste-index-report-2021) (UNEP): This dataset breaks down the food waste quantities by country for the consumer, retail, and food service sectors. This data will be used to compare US food waste in each sector to other countries around the globe. The data are comparable by standardizing into kg/capita/year units. 
- [2010 food loss by sector](https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/food-availability-per-capita-data-system/loss-adjusted-food-availability-documentation/) (UDSA): This report includes a table that estimates the total food loss in the US in 2010. It reports both the raw weight of food lost and the percentage of food lost by commodity type (grains products, fruits, etc.) and sector (retail vs. consumer). 
- [2018 Wasted Food Report](https://www.epa.gov/facts-and-figures-about-materials-waste-and-recycling/food-material-specific-data) (EPA): This report includes a table detailing the amount of food waste and management by sector (e.g. % of food waste from residentail sources that end up in the landfill).
-	[Public opinions](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/12/19/americans-say-theyre-changing-behaviors-to-help-the-environment-but-is-it-making-a-difference/) (Pew Research Center): surveys showing that Americans usually agree that food waste is an issue.
-	[Food insecurity statistics](https://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/food-nutrition-assistance/food-security-in-the-us/key-statistics-graphics.aspx) (UDSA): These tables showing the proportion of families that live in food insecurity or low food security.

# Method and medium

I plan to construct my final story using Shorthand. This platform provides an easy way to combine engaging visuals with text and supporting graphs to tell a story. It's great for creating an immersive and interactive experience without requiring any backend coding.

For the actual data visualizations, I’ll likely use a combination of Tableau and Flourish. Tableau will be used in cases where more data cleaning/manipulation is required to get the final visualization, or cases where a lot of customization is needed. Flourish can be used for visualizations that rely only on a few statistics or that can be directly created without much additional data cleaning. 

For the final presentation, I’ll plan to give a brief overview of the project using Shorthand as the supporting medium.
