# Visualizing Government Debt

This project analyzes governnment debt data from the OECD. The data can be accessed [here](https://data.oecd.org/gga/general-government-debt.htm).

### Debt-to-GDP ratio race chart, 1995-2020
Just for fun, here's an animation of the debt-to-GDP ratio for all countries. Use the dropdown to filter to a particular region. Hover over the dots to view country names and details. Highlighted countries are the same as those highlighted in the bar chart.

### Analysis

The bar graph is a great way to visualize a point-in-time comparison of the debt-to-GDP ratio across different countries. To further focus the message of the graph, certain highlighted countries are colored such that they stand out from the remaining countries. 

The two line-graph variations highlight change over time for each country. The grid chart very clearly shows whether the debt-to-GDP ratio is increasing or decreasing from 1995 to 2020. The animated race chart also shows change over time. However, it also allows for comparisons across different countries by showing them all on the same graph. The animation also helps highlight how countries have shifted in rank in terms of high versus low debt-to-GDP ratio over time. Due to the high number of countries, however, this chart is a bit cluttered with so many lines. Filtering by region helps reduce some of the clutter by zoning in on a subgroup of countries at a time. 

The streamgraphs allow for a quick and easy comparison of debto-to-GDP ratio across all countries. The magnitude of the ratio is now visualized as an area, and it is immediately apparent which countries have higher debt (larger areas) and how the debt-to-GDP ratio changed over time for each country. This additional visual dimension does not provide any new information regarding the data, but it does add another layer of visual cues to make the data more easily interpretable.
