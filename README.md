# About me
Hi! My name is Audrey, and I'm a graduate student at CMU studying public policy and data analytics. I am fascinated with the role that data play in addressing society's complex solutions. rior to grad school, I had the opportunity to help implement some very exciting Medicare innovation programs. I analyzed Medicare claims data to construct key indicators for program impact and synthesized insights for program improvement. It was amazing to see data insights get translated into concrete policy action and measurable outcomes.

# What I hope to learn
I love being creative and finding new ways to create compelling narratives through data visualizations. I'm hoping to learn some new data visualization techniques that could better represent information in digestable and intuitive ways. I'm also hoping to learn how to better use color to highlight relevant information and key insights. I'm excited to bring these techniques to my future role as a data scientist!
