This is a public portfolio for my Telling Stories with Data class at CMU. 

# About me
Hi! My name is Audrey, and I'm a graduate student at CMU studying public policy and data analytics. Originally from Vancouver, Canada, I spent a few years in Chicago before settling down in San Francisco as my current homebase. I love going on adventures, trying new activities, and meeting new people. A few hobbies include reading, solo traveling, and scuba diving. I am also an avid hot sauce enthusiast (hot sauce should accompany every meal of the day).

My professional background is in healthcare policy consulting, where I had the opportunity to help implement several Medicare innovation programs. I worked with Medicare claims data to construct key indicators to evaluate program impact and synthesized recommendations for program improvement. It was amazing to see data insights get translated into concrete policy action and measurable outcomes. Through that experience, I recognized the importance of conducting *good* data analysis, both to accurately interpret the data and to effectively communicate these findings to stakeholders. That's why I am focusing my graduate studies on how best to harness data to drive effective decision-making, both through bolstering my theoretical understanding and technical skills in machine learning, and through exploring the difficult topics surrounding ethics and interpretability of ML and AI. 

# What I hope to learn

The ability to create compelling narratives through visualizations is a foundational skill for any data scientist. This is why I'm excited about this class. I hope to learn new techniques to represent information through digestable and intuitive visualizations. I look forward to gaining hands-on practice with a variety of new tools I haven't used before and adding them to my repertoire as a data scientist. I'm also excited to exercise my creative muscles and bringing a more design-centric focus to my work.

My post-graduation plan is to join a management consulting firm as a data scientist. In this role, I need to bridge the gap between technical and non-technical audiences to drive effective decision-making through data. Data visualization is a shared language across technical backgrounds, so it is imperative that I learn to effectively communicate through memorable charts with clear messaging. I hope to leave this class with a more robust set of skills in each stage of the dataviz pipeline; from designing storyboards to collecting user feedback and ultimately executing on the visualizations.

Here are the projects I completed this semester.

### Visualizing Government Debt 

This project analyzes governnment debt data from the OECD. Check it out [here](/GovDebt.md).

### Visualization Critique & Re-design

In this project, I critiqued and created a re-design of a visualization showing the change in employment by sector in September 2021. Check it out [here](/
employment_changes.md)

### Final Project

For my final project, I wanted to create awareness and drive action surrounding food waste. It's something we can all do to help the world become more sustainable, and which can really make an impact on environmental outcomes. It's divided into three parts, with [part 1](/final_project_part_1.md) detailing the initial outline of the story.
