# Part 2: Wireframe and User Research

## Introduction
I developed my project wireframe using Shorthand. I picked this tool because I wanted to give both myself and my audience a sense of what the final product might look like. Building off of the outline developed in Part I and incorporating the feedback I received, I refined the outline with further details and added in the key callout statistics I wanted to use to guide my story. I then planned out the type of data visualization I would add in each main section to support my overall message. In order to present my interviewees with a high-fidelity impression of my final project, I decided to build out the draft visualizations using Flourish and Tableau. This also helped guide my decision-making through a better understanding of my datasets and what visualizations are ultimately feasible. 

The wireframe of my project is linked [here](https://preview.shorthand.com/jQibGBYrE5IeiEkR). It’s fairly bare-bones, with only the key text and data visualizations as content. In building this wireframe, I struggled a little with presenting the various visualizations in an order that makes sense. In particular, due to data limitations, there are some statistics/charts that use global data, and others use data from the U.S. only. Some charts also overlap two topics; for instance, the alluvial chart can both be used to support the point that residential/households are the biggest producers of food waste, and that majority of the waste ends up in landfills. I made sure to include that in my user research to get some feedback in terms of story flow. 

## User Research 
My target audience is for the project is the general public, as food waste is an issue pertinent to our everyday lives. A key subset demographic I’d like to target is the environmentally- and socially-conscious individuals who are middle-class or above (i.e. do not experience food insecurity), who would be swayed by data-driven evidence, and would care about both the ethical and environmental implications of food waste. I believe that this demographic would mostly likely be persuaded by the presentation and take action for more responsible food usage in their own lives. I also want to target audiences with varying levels background in data analytics/visualization, to ensure that my final project is intuitive and understandable to all. I identified three users for interview, with the following characteristics.
-	User A: female policy student (30). Some data analytics experience but no extensive background in data visualization.
-	User B: female policy student (27), with extensive experience in communicating using data. 
-	User C: male mechanical engineer (32), with some background in communicating to stakeholders with data. 

## Interview Protocol
In addition to collecting data on overall flow of the story as mentioned earlier, I also wanted to get specific feedback on the design and implementation of each visualization. In particular, I wanted to make sure that each visualization is clear (intuitive/easy to understand), useful (supports surrounding context), and impactful (delivers the key message). I thus decided to develop a set of questions I would ask about each visualization as I walk through the presentation with my interviewees, and another set of questions to ask about the overall presentation at the end. Below is a summary of the interview questions, and responses from each individual. Note that given the timing between scheduled interviews, I iteratively updated some aspects of the wireframe between interviews.   
For each visualization, I asked the following three questions: 
-	For intuitiveness/perceptibility: “At first glance, what are you seeing here?” 
-	For comprehension, engagement: “What do you think the main message here is?”
-	For usefulness and flow: “Does this visual complement the surrounding context?” 
-	Additional: “Do you have any additional feedback? 
After the overall presentation, I asked the following questions:
-	For story flow: “Overall, did the flow of the story and data make sense?
-	For storytelling effectiveness: “Is it clear what the target audience and ‘call-to-action’ is?
-	Additional feedback: “What would you change? 

## Feedback
The feedback from the users are summarized below.

Graph 1: % of Households with Food Insecurity
| Question | User A | User B | User C |
| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | 
| What are you seeing here?| On average, households with children experience more food insecurity; large jump in food insecurity after the great recession for both segments; more or less parallel trend until 2020 | Two parallel trends; I'm surprised households with children are higher | Two line graphs; one representing all households and one with children. We're in about the same position now as in 98
