# Part 2: Wireframe and User Research

## Introduction
I developed my project wireframe using Shorthand. I picked this tool because I wanted to give both myself and my audience a sense of what the final product might look like. Building off of the outline developed in Part I and incorporating the feedback I received, I refined the outline with further details and added in the key callout statistics I wanted to use to guide my story. I then planned out the type of data visualization I would add in each main section to support my overall message. In order to present my interviewees with a high-fidelity impression of my final project, I decided to build out the draft visualizations using Flourish and Tableau. This also helped guide my decision-making through a better understanding of my datasets and what visualizations are ultimately feasible. 

The wireframe of my project is linked [here](https://preview.shorthand.com/jQibGBYrE5IeiEkR). It’s fairly bare-bones, with only the key text and data visualizations as content. In building this wireframe, I struggled a little with presenting the various visualizations in an order that makes sense. In particular, due to data limitations, there are some statistics/charts that use global data, and others use data from the U.S. only. Some charts also overlap two topics; for instance, the alluvial chart can both be used to support the point that residential/households are the biggest producers of food waste, and that majority of the waste ends up in landfills. I made sure to include that in my user research to get some feedback in terms of story flow. 

## User Research 
My target audience is for the project is the general public, as food waste is an issue pertinent to our everyday lives. A key subset demographic I’d like to target is the environmentally- and socially-conscious individuals who are middle-class or above (i.e. do not experience food insecurity), who would be swayed by data-driven evidence, and would care about both the ethical and environmental implications of food waste. I believe that this demographic would mostly likely be persuaded by the presentation and take action for more responsible food usage in their own lives. I also want to target audiences with varying levels background in data analytics/visualization, to ensure that my final project is intuitive and understandable to all. I identified three users for interview, with the following characteristics.
-	User A: female policy student (30). Some data analytics experience but no extensive background in data visualization.
-	User B: female policy student (27), with extensive experience in communicating using data. 
-	User C: male mechanical engineer (32), with some background in communicating to stakeholders with data. 

## Interview Protocol
In addition to collecting data on overall flow of the story as mentioned earlier, I also wanted to get specific feedback on the design and implementation of each visualization. In particular, I wanted to make sure that each visualization is clear (intuitive/easy to understand), useful (supports surrounding context), and impactful (delivers the key message). I thus decided to develop a set of questions I would ask about each visualization as I walk through the presentation with my interviewees, and another set of questions to ask about the overall presentation at the end. Below is a summary of the interview questions, and responses from each individual. Note that given the timing between scheduled interviews, I iteratively updated some aspects of the wireframe between interviews.   
For each visualization, I asked the following three questions: 
-	For intuitiveness/perceptibility: “At first glance, what are you seeing here?” 
-	For comprehension, engagement: “What do you think the main message here is?”
-	For usefulness and flow: “Does this visual complement the surrounding context?” 
-	Additional: “Do you have any additional feedback?" 

After the entire presentation, I also asked the following questions:
-	For story flow: “Overall, did the flow of the story and data make sense?
-	For storytelling effectiveness: “Is it clear what the target audience and ‘call-to-action’ is?
-	Additional feedback: “What would you change? 

## Feedback
The feedback from the users are summarized below. Note that since the order of information was edited between iterations, the order of the graphs below may not be the final order presented in the wireframe.

### Graph 1: % of Households with Food Insecurity (Line graph)
| Question | User A | User B | User C |
| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | 
| What are you seeing here?| On average, households with children experience more food insecurity; large jump in food insecurity after the great recession for both segments; more or less parallel trend until 2020 | Two parallel trends; I'm surprised households with children are higher | Two line graphs; one representing all households and one with children. We're in about the same position now as in '98 |
| What do you think the main message is? | Households with children experience higher food insecurity | Families with young children experience more food insecurity | Households with children have more food insecurity (sad!) |
| Does this visual complement the surrounding context? | Yes in that it's in line with the food waste vs. food insecurity; there hasn't been a mention on households with children. | Yes definitely | I think the term 'stark contrast' is misleading since the chart isn't showing any contrast. Maybe it would make more sense to have just one line for all households, since that's the main message of the story. |
| Additional Feedback | Make it clear why the line with children is represented | Color is good; but trouble understanding what the unit is. Also having trouble understanding what percentage translates to in terms of people; contextualize? | The labels are not prominent enough (the legend is not as visible as ideal). It would also be nice if both data points (households with children and all) would show up. |

### Graph 2: Annual Food Waste by Country (Choloropleth map)
| Question | User A | User B | User C |
| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | 
|What are you seeing here? | US, China are biggest food wasters per capita in the world. The selection filters are not super apparent at first| Spread of food waste; relatively evenly distributed except for Nigeria; looks like Russia has exceptionally low |Map of the world, with values with no legend | 
|What do you think the main message is? | Dynamic way of looking at how food waste is dispersed throughout the world, and looking at which countries are worse by different sources. It's surprising which countries have high waste values looking at total waste.|More global issue than I thought; first assumption is that wealthier countries would have higher food waste  | China is very wasteful in terms of total food waste. The graph of food waste seems to be only half of the message here.| 
| Does this visual complement the surrounding context? |Yes; gives more context around what was just discussed beforehand | The assumption is you want us to feel that it's an issue that transcends our own backyard; everyone contributes to the broader problem| Maybe separate the two statements where you talk about 'the undernourishment' problem? The graphic is about regionalization but the statement is about the world as a whole. | 
|Additional Feedback | Make the colors have more contrast|The controls/filters make sense! | I would expect a color scale to show the range of figures. Think the title tries to be too specific. Maybe something like "food waste by country". Think color scale and metric gets lost in the dropdown box. Do you need to manipulate the data? | 


### Graph 3: Greenhouse Emissions by Food Waste and Countries (Bar graph)
| Question | User A | User B | User C |
| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | 
|At first glance, what are you seeing here? |Food waste in general is huge GH emissions offender; well ahead of the next closest country of India |Color draws my eyes to food first, still shocked at how much China and US beat food production; also wondering how much of food carbon emissions are represented by food production…  | Reducing food waste could help us with greenhouse gasses. | 
|What do you think the main message is? |Same as above |Food waste is significant contributor of GH emissions |Food waste is an environmental impact beyond the social impact. | 
| Does this visual complement the surrounding context? | Yes|I think so |This is better than the previous two tiles.|  

### Graph 4: Homes are the Largest Source of Food Waste (Donut chart)
| Question | User A | User B | User C |
| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | 
|At first glance, what are you seeing here? | Homes account for almost half of food waste in US, more than food service industry which is incredible | I think this feels like a departure from other flowchart; homes are still largest flowchart but is much closer to groceries and other retailers. Might be useful to label the percentages here.| A donut chart| 
|What do you think the main message is? |Same thing; households themselves are big source of waste and should be addressed as a way to curb food waste. I'm curious what the difference is between restaurant and food service category | Homes and restaurants/groceries… take up most of the donut | Waste at the home is the biggest contributor | 
| Does this visual complement the surrounding context? | Yes | It does, but feels like it harkens back to flowchart | Yes | 
|Additional Feedback | | | Maybe add a subheading to make the data shown more clear? | 

### Graph 5: Household Waste Mostly ends up in Landfills (Sankey diagram)
| Question | User A | User B | User C |
| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | 
|At first glance, what are you seeing here? |This is interesting. It looks like a flowchart of what proportion of waste from different sources ends up in different areas | Shockingly, residential food waste contributes more to landfills | Sankey chart, showing movement of waste| 
|What do you think the main message is? | Can see right off the bad that residential waste contributes greatly to landfill (a little under half). Also the plurality of all waste ends up in landfills. | Shockingly individuals contribute to landfills through what sounds like overconsumption . Residential contribution to landfills is about the same as from all other sources|Food waste mostly ends up in landfills  | 
| Does this visual complement the surrounding context? | I think so… you mention landfills in the sentence right above. I would be interested in other areas like controlled combustion… what is that? |Makes sense |Yes? But I find my eyes drawn to the remaining destinations other than Landfill. Maybe make Landfill brighter and more impactful  | 
|Additional Feedback | What are the units on these numbers? | Colors are intuitive| I'm not sure what "institutional" means. Why are we discretizing the data here between households and other sources?  | 


### Graph 6: Food Waste by Type from Retailers and Consumers (Bubble/dot)
| Question | User A | User B | User C |
| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | 
|At first glance, what are you seeing here? |Meat poultry and fish are the largest in terms of money lost, but are not the most wasted in terms of weight. It's interesting that Grain is highest for retail lost. Vegetables for consumers are the largest wasted food item by lbs for consumers.|I'm surprised consumers waste so much more meat than retailers; I'm shocked by how little we consume other things like eggs | Bubble chart. Sizes represent how much money is associated with each category. | 
|What do you think the main message is? |There's a difference between food waste and financial waste |I'm not sure. There's a pretty even spread of the categories and amounts being wasted  | The graph does not help me at all. Meat poultry and fish is expensive.| 
| Does this visual complement the surrounding context? |Yes; it took a second to process the chart but the two sentences prior made it a lot easier to interpret. |Kind of; because I didn't read the text it didn't feel like it did, with the text it makes sense |Not really. Maybe change the title to 'what foods do we waste'?  | 
|Additional Feedback |Not super intuitive with so much data. Why are the food types broken out to different bubbles? Maybe combine the categorical bubbles. Maybe represent consumer dollars lost more clearly? That was interesting to me and I think it would be interesting to others. Can make the size total dollars lost but break down dollars b/t consumers and retail. Also add US to the title to make it clear it's for the US  |I think there's potential to combine the bubbles; can also change the title to be more descriptive to guide the viewer | It seems like the retailer metric is not very useful here. Maybe simplify to just a dot plot using the two consumer-related variables. Size feels like a tertiary variable; only add size when it's needed and should represent the least important variable. | 

### General feedback: 
| Question | User A | User B | User C |
| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | 
|Overall, did the flow of the story and data make sense?| I think so. I think region-wise it was a bit confusing to go from US to global to US again, so maybe find a way to make that flow more natural? |I like the landfill one where it is now; would move the greenhouse emissions up behind the map. Otherwise I like your hook, then moving from global to US then residential.  | I would try to pull up the problem of consumers being the biggest source of waste earlier, since this is the key point of this story. | 
|Is it clear what the target audience and  'call-to-action' is?| Target audience is everyday Americans/average consumer, or some sort of food non-profit or even policy majors. Call to action: understanding why you're wasting food, why it matters, environmental impact. The amount of space in landfills was shocking, so was a key takeaway. | Yes, think your call to action is very clear and thorough which I appreciate. I like that there are different scales/types of action. It feels coherent as a story | Everyday citizens who eat at home are the target audience.  The 'call-to-action' is clear. I compost!| 
|What would you change?| Water waste for milk and beef - is that water used for production? On your charts, the axes and labels maybe not using such a light gray, some screens might not show up.|Other than the stuff I mentioned… The empire state building graphic… it's hard to picture the scale with a pictogram like this, it might make more sense to just have a scrollable image to give a sense of scale. |I'd add a sentence describing what food waste is off the get-go. The thought that there was industrial food waste and other sources did not really sink in for me. | 

## Key Takeaways
The feedback overall was extremely helpful in identifying next steps. The interviewees pointed out many details that I had overlooked when drafting the wireframe, such as making sure all the units are available and legible, clarifying the titles of charts, and general flow of the story. 

One consistent finding was that the bubble chart showing the pounds of food waste by food category for retailers versus consumers, along with the total consumer dollars lost for each category, took a while to digest and make sense to the viewer. All suggested that combining the categories would make more sense, and consolidate the information so the audience can focus on the key message. For instance, in the initial iteration of this chart, the ‘meat, poultry, and seafood’ category was split into three bubbles for ‘meat’, ‘poultry’, and ‘seafood’ individually. I have incorporated this feedback into my final wireframe. I also changed the chart from a bubble chart to a dot plot, showing the consumer dollars and pounds of food waste by food category. This eliminates the extraneous data of retailer loss. 

Another interesting finding is that the line graph showing percentage of households experiencing food insecurity for all households versus households with children. I decided that introducing the statistic about children is somewhat distracting from the main point (which is that we're wasting so much food while a significant portion of people are still going hungry), so I removed that line. I also revised the text to make the linkage between the two points more clear. 

Another salient point was the overall flow of the story when it came to jumping between global and U.S. statistics. User B suggested a very helpful approach of using the initial U.S. statistics as a hook, then moving from focusing on global to U.S. to households in order. I also incorporated this feedback in the final wireframe. User C also gave some good feedback in linking the transition between sections. I used his feedback to trim down the text and also clean up the visualizations to only focus on the important aspects. For instance, I removed the line showing percentage of U.S. households with children experiencing food insecurity from that chart. 

Generally, it seems the main point of each visualization could be further clarified to make the visuals 'punchier' and straight to the point. This could be improved by clarifying titles, as well as getting rid of extraneous information in both the charts and the surrounding text. For instance, in the cholopleth map, I removed the dropdown filter to select data showing food waste from residential versus retail versus total. I also incorporated a color key to make the gradients more clearly interpretable. 

## Future Updates
-	Update axes colors to a darker gray for improved visibility, and ensure units are visible 
-	Clean up categorization of sources of food waste (residential vs. household…) to use consistent labelling
-	Consider playing with color to further highlight the important aspects of each chart (the dot plot showing consumer food waste by dollars versus pounds, for example, is still hard to know where to focus on). This would help drive home the point of each visualization 
-	Verify that the units are present on each graph. Also confirm that the scope of data is clear (i.e. U.S. versus global data) 
- consider adding definitions for 'food waste', and/or definitions for the various breakdowns in food waste generation (household vs. retail, etc.) 
- Take another look at structuring the story in terms of overall flow
