# Part 3: Putting it All Together

In [part 2](final_project_part_2.md) of my final project, I wireframed my data story, created draft visuals, and conducted user research to get feedback on the wireframe and charts. The last piece of my assignment is putting it all together to create a compelling narrative about food waste, with supporting visuals that would both inform the audience of an issue and guide them to action. This page summarizes the process of creating the final product, but feel free to skip ahead and check out the final project [here](https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/waste-not-want-not/index.html). 

## Implementing User Feedback

In part 2, I created a wireframe using Shorthand, which is also the medium I’m using for the final product. As such, I was able to continue working in the same platform, incorporating the remaining feedback from my user research and putting the final polish on the finished product. 
In response to the feedback about the wireframed story feeling ‘jumpy’, I played around with the ordering of content, finally deciding to move the ‘reasons we waste’ section to the final section leading into the calls-to-action. I also cleaned up the visualizations to use consistent terminology between visualizations, such as using ‘households’ to refer to all consumer waste in different charts to improve overall cohesiveness. 
Lastly, I made final touch-ups on my graphs, making the axes darker/easier to read and adding in any missing sources, units, or axes labels. Since I do move between US and global statistics between sections, I made sure that each visualization can stand independently and still provide context as to the scope of the represented statistics. Lastly, I addressed the issue of the dot plot showing US consumer loss by weight and value of food categories. In Part 2, I received feedback that the size of dots was difficult to interpret, so I had removed one dimension of data to only show the weight and value loss by pounds and dollars on my graph. However, I still received feedback that it was hard to know where to focus on. I tried playing with color, but was unable to find a color scheme that highlighted the two main callouts (we waste more vegetables by weight and more proteins by value). I then played with sizing, adding in a dimension to represent the size using calories, but that just over-complicated the graph again. I ultimately decided on flipping the X and Y axes. The range in value lost in terms of billion dollars is much higher than the range in weight lost in billion pounds, and by flipping the axes, I found it easier to see proteins as an immediate outlier, and vegetables as the highest dot of the cluster. 

## Thinking about Audience

The intended audience for my data story is every day consumers. I want the story to be as relevant to as many people as possible, since food waste is a widespread problem across the country that we can all take action to address. With this in mind, I re-read and edited my story, cleaning it up to remove excess text and improve the flow. This is not a complex topic, so I wanted the product to emphasize more on impactful photos and visualizations rather than chunks of text in order to capture the audience and not lose their attention. This also helped the callout statistics stand out more, as the reader does not have to read through a paragraph of text to get the main point of each section. 
There was one piece of feedback from my user research about separating out the ‘restaurants, groceries, and food services’ category in the donut chart to show more granularity. Unfortunately, I was unable to find a more granular dataset with this information, so I decided not to split those out. I also made this judgement call as my overall story is intended for every day consumers like myself as the main audience. The point I’m trying to get across is that this is an issue that we play a big role in, and should thus feel responsibility for the problem. As such, data focusing on households is most relevant, and breakdown of waste generated by other sources like restaurants and retailers is less relevant. This thought process on the intended audience did inspire me to further simplify some category labels, though. For instance, in the alluvial chart, an everyday consumer is not likely to know what “anaerobic digestion” is. So, I relabeled this category as ‘bacterial digestion’ (anaerobic digestion is simply processing by microorganisms without the presence of oxygen). This also helped make the labels on this graph easier to read, as there’s a lot of text grouped rather close together in the bottom right of the graph.

## Designing the End Product

After making the updates mentioned above, I started putting together the final touches. In my original research phase I had found a few pictures I wanted to use in my story, and used a color palette tool to pick out colors from these images and create a palette. I wanted the palette to be reminiscent of harvest, food, and food getting old, so focused my palette on muted oranges and yellows, and cool blues. I was also somewhat limited by the image of the Empire State Building I found, based on prior feedback that an image that really shows the scale/immensity of the building would drive home the point about how much food we waste. Luckily, I found an image that echoed similar yellow/brown and cool slate tones. Additionally, I used a lot of grays to de-emphasize data in visualizations, and tried also to pick shades of gray that were slightly on the cooler side of the color spectrum. I had used these colors in my draft visuals and got some good feedback, so I decided to keep this color schema and build out my final product around this palette. To do so, I spent some time on Unsplash looking for images that were both thematic and fit the color scheme. It was a little challenging as rotting food is not the most aesthetically pleasing thing to photograph, but through some creative terminology search I was able to compile a collection of photos I could use. 
The final step was to put it all together using Shorthand. The tool took a little getting used to, and I definitely spent a significant amount of time playing with different formats of pictures overlaid with text, layouts of graphs, sizing of text, etc. It helped that my project is not text-heavy, so I could incorporate a bunch of images to make the end product visually appealing without being overly distracting. 

## Final Thoughts

Overall, I had a lot of fun building this project from start to finish, and am excited to have a final product that incorporates all the learnings about design, visualizations, and communicating with data in one place!
