# Data Visualization Critique

For this assignment, I decided to critique the chart in the [CNBC article]<https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/08/where-the-jobs-are-september-2021-chart.html> titled "Here's Where the Jobs Are - in One Chart". I have always been interested in policy discussions surrounding education, and am curious how the COVID-19 pandemic and related political tensions regarding mask mandates and vaccine mandates may affect our public schools. The artile makes the point that "[p]ublic schools often bouy the September jobs report as \[public school districts\] hire teachers, bus drivers, administrators, and other staff back for the start of the fall term... That did not happen as it normally does in 2021". However, the provided chart does not make it clear the impact of public school employment on overall employment numbers. Instead, the reader only finds out through further reading that Government employment includes public education employmnet at the state and local levels, with overall employment dereasing by 144,000 in local government education and 17,000 in state government education, seasonally adjusted.
